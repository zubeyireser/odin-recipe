    <h1>Turkish Kebab</h1>

    <p>This is my version of Turkish kebabs which I made 'off the cuff' after searching unsuccessfully for a recipe online. The original sandwiches are made from meat that is pressed into a loaf and grilled on a rotating spit. The meat is shaved off as it gets crispy and then put into a pita sandwich. My recipe calls for thin slices of meat to be marinated and then broiled to get the same effect without a huge rotating grill. Serve in a warmed pita with goat cheese, tzatziki sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and pepperoncinis.

    <ul>
        <li> 2 large onions, chopped </li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li> 1/2 cup olive oil</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 pinch curry powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 pound beef flank steak, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For the Tzatziki Sauce:    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces sour cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>6 pita bread rounds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Direction</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the chopped onions in a large ceramic bowl and crush with the bottom of a glass until juice is rendered and onions look translucent. Stir in 2 crushed garlic cloves, 1/2 cup olive oil, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, oregano, 1 teaspoon black pepper, turmeric, curry powder, and 1 teaspoon salt. Mix well; add the sliced beef and toss to coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and marinate in the refrigerator overnight.</li>
        <li>Combine the sour cream, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, dill, and 1 crushed clove of garlic. Mix well; cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.</li>
        <li>Remove the meat from the marinade mixture, brushing off extra onions. Spread the slices on a baking sheet without overlapping, and salt to taste. Broil about 3 minutes per side or until browned and crispy, turning halfway through cooking.</li>
        <li>Divide the cooked meat between the pita breads, and drizzle with tzatziki sauce to serve.</li>
    </ol>
